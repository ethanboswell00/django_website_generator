# django_website_generator

This website generator makes a simple Django website that can be deployed in your local environment. Just run './main.py' and enter the options on the Tkinter GUI.

After running the script, the .html file to edit the website's material will be available in %website_name_dir%/templates. This website is Bootstrap-ready and can be designed with Bootstrap code.
